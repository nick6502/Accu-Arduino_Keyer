# Accu-Arduino_Keyer
An Arduino sketch that reproduces the logic of the Accu-Keyer from QST August, 1973
The program (sketch) runs on an ATmega328 Arduino such as the Nano or Pro-mini.
The Accu-Keyer was a very popular project from QST, developed by WB4VVF and using 7400 series TTL ICs. My intent is not to merely program a keyer that behaves like the Accu-Keyer but to emulate each gate and flip-flop in the circuit in order to, I hope, produce a very faithful emulation of the hardware version of the keyer.
I include a manual with schematic, the .ino file, and a redrawn schematic of the original - the available digital QST article is too low-rez to read. That schematic is for information only and not necessary for the Arduino project.
